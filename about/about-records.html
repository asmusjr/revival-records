Here at Revival Records, we pride ourselves on having a wide variety of new and used vinyl to choose from.
Although we carry a little bit of everything, our largest genres to choose from are pop and rock.
Don't get discouraged if rock isn't your thing, we have a good sized collection of jazz, blues, reggae, folk, classical, 
soundtracks, country, kids and world music too.
Most of the stacks at Revival Records are made up of used vinyl but we have a sizeable stock of new vinyl and it's growing every week!
Ask the staff about their favorite albums, new or old if you're looking to try something new. Oh yeah, and we've got CDs too!
A big way we build our collection of used vinyl and CDs is from people bringing in music to sell or trade.
In addition to a great selection of vinyl, you can find all sorts of record accessories at Revival Records.
We have cleaning supplies, protective inner and outer sleeves and frames for displaying your favorite records.
And for those tough cleaning jobs we offer a professional cleaning service here at the store.
Revival Records has an ever changing selection of home audio equipment.
We have new and used turntables, receivers, speakers and pre-amps for sale.
We also purchase used equipment for cash or trade if you are looking to upgrade your stereo.

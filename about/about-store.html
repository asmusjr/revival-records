Walking into Revival Records for the first time, one gets an overwhelming sense of community.
It is a community of seekers,
not only in the sense of finding the next great piece of nostalgia or favorite hit song,
but seekers of ideas,
movements and emotions, 
of like-minded ears and close friends.
Old 45s hang from the ceiling as if to say those who enter have a common goal in preserving music and sharing it with others.
The staff will share their favorite recent albums with you as if you are family,
and the old phonograph player, 
displayed prominently on one shelf, 
is a reminder that what this store is selling goes beyond just goods. 
Revival Records is in the business of sharing the experience.
Sifting through record crates and shelves, 
bringing a favorite album to the counter, 
and bringing it home to play for oneself and others is a timeless act that allows others to share their ideas within the Chippewa Valley community and beyond.
Revival Records has created an atmosphere that promotes the sharing of the listening experience and feels like a lot more than a business, it feels like an extension of home.
